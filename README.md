# Bank_Management_System
 This is just a simple project using Java and Jswing.
 ### Purpose:
 The goal of this project is to develop an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) simulation that offers consumers a fictitious banking experience. Users may authenticate themselves with a card number and password and carry out fundamental banking activities including cash withdrawals, cash deposits, and analysing statements of transactions using the simulation, which seeks to mimic the capabilities of an actual ATM. While putting an emphasis on security precautions and protecting user data privacy, the project aims to deliver a realistic and user-friendly interface that replicates the interactions and operations of a physical ATM. The project's goal is to provide customers with an easy way to practise and comprehend an ATM's features by mimicking the experience, making it easier for them to become accustomed to banking.
